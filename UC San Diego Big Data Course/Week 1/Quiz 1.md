   <li><strong>What reasoning was given for the following: why is the "data storage to price ratio" relevant to big data?</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lower prices mean larger storage becomes easier to access for everyone, creating bigger amounts of data for client-facing services to work with.</strong></li>
    <li>Companies can't afford to own, maintain, and spend the energy to support large data storage unless the cost is sufficiently low.</li>
    <li>Larger storage means easier accessibility to big data for every user because it allows users to download in bulk.</li>
    <li>It isn't, it was just an arbitrary example of big data usage.</li>
