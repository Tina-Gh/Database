### 4. What are the two key components of HDFS and what are they used for?

- NameNode for block storage and Data Node for metadata.
- **NameNode for metadata and DataNode for block storage.**
- FASTA for genome sequence and Rasters for geospatial data.

### 5. What is the job of the NameNode?

- **Coordinate operations and assigns tasks to Data Nodes**
- Listens from DataNode for block creation, deletion, and replication.
- For gene sequencing calculations.

### 6. What is the order of the three steps to Map Reduce?

- Shuffle and Sort -> Reduce -> Map
- **Map -> Shuffle and Sort -> Reduce**
- Shuffle and Sort -> Map -> Reduce
- Map -> Reduce -> Shuffle and Sort

### 7. What is a benefit of using pre-built Hadoop images?

- Quick prototyping, deploying, and guaranteed bug free.
- Less software choices to choose from.
- **Quick prototyping, deploying, and validating of projects.**
- Guaranteed hardware support.

### 8. What is an example of open-source tools built for Hadoop and what does it do?

- Zookeeper, analyze social graphs.
- Pig, for real-time and in-memory processing of big data.
- **Zookeeper, management system for animal named related components**
- Giraph, for SQL-like queries.

### 9. What is the difference between low level interfaces and high level interfaces?

- Low level deals with interactivity while high level deals with storage and scheduling.
- **Low level deals with storage and scheduling while high level deals with interactivity.**

### 10. Which of the following are problems to look out for when integrating your project with Hadoop?

- **Handle Fault Tolerance**
- **Optimized for a Variety of Data Types**
- **Provide Value for Data**

### 12. What is the purpose of YARN?

- **Allows various applications to run on the same Hadoop cluster.**
- Enables large scale data across clusters.
- Implementation of Map Reduce.

### 13. What are the two main components for a data computation framework that were described in the slides?

- Node Manager and Container
- Resource Manager and Container
- Applications Master and Container
- Node Manager and Applications Master
- **Resource Manager and Node Manager**
